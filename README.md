This Python based Simple Calculator, built using the Tkinter Library, supports four mathematical commands:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication and
4. Division

As mentioned above I used Tkinter to load a Graphical User Interface into Pycharm.

I decided to create an expressions bar at the top of the frame that will display the input that the user is providing in real time and give an output after the “equals to” button is pressed.

I renamed this Calculator app to “Simple Calculator”.

I decided to go with this nice pastel blue color as the background of my Calculator because I believed that the color was appealing enough from the user perspective and is fairly easy on the eyes. Neither to flashy nor too faded.

And just in case you are curious, the color code of the color that I’ve used is: #99c2ff.

I have assigned the framing of this calculator as 532x465 which resonates to 532 pixels of width and 465 pixels of height.

I have added one additional feature which is to not allow the user to resize the calculators frame because, the frame of the calculator when resized, increases the amount of black space in the background which to me, looks extremely unprofessionally done.

Importantly, I did actually add the bitmap icon to my calculator app, but it later turns out that Mac Operating System does not display the icon at the top left side of the calculator when the code is executed.

For now this calculator can only perform simple mathematical calculations but I plan on adding more features and fuctionalities to it later on.

I got many of the design and programming ideas for this calculator on Stack Overflow.
