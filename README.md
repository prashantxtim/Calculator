This Python based Simple Calculator, built sing the Tkinter Library, supports four mathematical commands:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication and

For now this calculator can only perform simple mathematical calculations but I plan on adding more features and fuctionalities to it later on.

I got majorities of design and programming ideas for this calculator on Stack Overflow.
